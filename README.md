# TravelKashmir - Demo Static Site (GitHub Pages ready)

This repository is a demo scaffold for a travel site focused on Kashmir. All content is original sample content intended for development and testing.

## What's included
- `index.html`, `packages.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`
- `styles/styles.css`, `scripts/main.js`, `scripts/load-featured.js`
- `data/packages.json` with 12 demo packages
- `assets/*.svg` placeholder images
- Instructions below to deploy to GitHub Pages

## How to deploy to GitHub Pages (simple)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public or private).
2. Upload all files (either via `git` or by dragging the zip contents to the repository web UI).
3. In the repository settings, go to **Pages** and choose the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder, then save.
4. After a minute, your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`

## Notes
- Replace `data/packages.json` and images with your real data and photos.
- The contact form is a demo (no backend). Use Formspree, Netlify Forms, or your own API to collect messages.
- Do not copy content from other websites without permission.
