# Kashmir Trails — Static Website

A modern, responsive static site for a Kashmir travel agency. No build tools needed — just upload the folder to any static host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, Vercel, cPanel).

## Pages
- `index.html` — Homepage with hero video, value props, featured packages
- `packages.html` — Filterable packages
- `gallery.html` — Masonry-style photo gallery
- `about.html` — Company overview
- `blog.html` — Placeholder blog cards
- `booking.html` — Booking request form (preselect via `?pkg=`)
- `contact.html` — Contact form
- `privacy.html` — Simple privacy note

## Forms
Currently wired to Formspree test endpoint. Replace `action` URLs with your CRM/email gateway before going live.

## Customize
- Edit text/images directly in each page.
- Colors and spacing in `css/styles.css`.
- Logo in `assets/logo.svg` and favicon in `assets/favicon.svg`.

## WordPress?
If you need this as a WordPress theme, copy the markup into template files (`header.php`, `footer.php`, `index.php`, etc.) or ask me and I’ll convert it for you.
